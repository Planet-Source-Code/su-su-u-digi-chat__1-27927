This program has many functions on top of being just an Instant
Messenger. Such functions include File Transfer, Whiteboard, Reading
out incoming messages using different voices and more...Since the last 
feature mentioned requires Microsoft's Text-To-Speech engine, you'll 
need to install it. The TTS Engines are accompanied with this software
package, so you'll just have to install it.

Descriptions of each Feature:
	
	File Transfer -	It can transfer files from one computer to the
			other. It shows the progress and the percentage
			of the file being sent. It first asks the user
			if he/she wants to receive the file. If the 
			reply is yes then the transfer begins and when 
			it finishes, prompts the user to save the file
			in the Hard Disk with the desired name.
	
	Whiteboard    -	This is a handy drawing tool that allows 2 
			people to draw together (virtually), meaning 
			that both sides will see the same picture. It
			allows the user to customize the background 
			color, brush size and brush color.

	Text-To-Speech-	This is an unique feature that actually reads 
			out the incoming messages using different 
			voices through the speaker. Voices are 
			installed by the TTS engine(s) and 2 voice 
			packages are already included with this program
			package. However, more voices can be downloaded
			at either Microsoft's homepage or other
			software companies's website like 
			"http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/file_description/0,fid,6593,00.asp". 
			But they are mostly sharewares...Settings for this feature
			can be configured in the 'Options' page.
	
	Popup Msg     - This prompts the sender to enter a msg, then 
			this msg is sent to the other side and is 
			displayed through a little animated window 
			which pops up at the bottom right-hand corner
			of the screen. A 'beep' can be heard also. This
			function is similar to the one MSN Messenger 
			already has. Options found on the 'Options'
			page.

	Getting other - This gathers some info of the other side (IP
	side's Info     Address, Name and Email address(If provided)).
			The info is then displayed on a form with a 
			background of randomly generated gradient color
			. When the user clicks the 'Close' button, a 
			mini animation is played to close the form.
	
	Customizing  -	In the 'Options' page, different background 
	Backgrounds  	options are available for the Main Chat Window.
			There's standard, Gradient and Custom BMP. 
			Standard is self-explanatory. If 'Gradient' is 
			chosen, each time the program starts it will
			generate a random gradient color to be is BG.
			Custom BMP allows the user to insert his/her
			own picture in Bitmap (.bmp) format to be the
			window's BG. The picture is preferred to have
			a height of 3970 twips and a width of 5595 
			twips to fit the window.
